# Surrogate Models for Storm Surge Prediction

## **Introduction**
Surrogate models or metamodels play a crucial role in emulating expensive numerical simulators with a high degree of accuracy. They achieve this by providing a mathematical approximation based on a dataset initially generated by a computationally expensive, high-fidelity model. The key advantage lies in their ability to significantly reduce computational costs, making them particularly valuable when examining multiple hypothetical scenarios for short- or long-term risk assessments. In the context of critical infrastructure, these models become instrumental in exploring even the occurrence of rare events.

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this study is to apply data-driven surrogate models to predict storm surge time-series for multiple locations as a Tropical Cyclone (TC) approaches landfall. High-fidelity numerical simulations of this complex phenomenon demand extensive Central Processing Unit (CPU) hours, limiting the exploration of storm scenarios for a given region. In this context, our focus will be on utilizing a Gaussian Process metamodel and exploring nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, with specific attention given to AutoEncoders. This approach aims to enhance the efficiency of storm surge predictions while addressing the computational constraints associated with high-fidelity simulations.

## **Plan**
The database utilized in this study was developed by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (ERDC-CHL) to support the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study (NACCS). The portion of the database used in this study corresponds to 595 landfalling storms, separated into four track groups that correspond to 89 distinct tracks (referred to as Master Tracks – MTs) for this storm ensemble. 

All storms are characterized by unique combinations of the following parameters:
- **Landfall Location**: Defined by the latitude (`xlat`) and longitude (`xlon`) of the storm track.
- **Heading Direction**: During the final approach to landfall (`β`).
- **Central Pressure Deficit**: (`ΔP`).
- **Translational Speed**: (`vts`).
- **Radius of Maximum Wind Speed**: (`Rmw`).

The heading direction (`β`) and the combination of latitude (`xlat`) and longitude (`xlon`) dictate the MT. The remaining parameters that dictate the strength (`ΔP`), size (`Rmw`), and translational speed (`vts`) characteristics of each synthetic storm further distinguish storms that correspond to the same MT. The resulting database provides time-series simulation for a total of **18,977 save points (SPs)**.

As a research assistant, I will be exploring dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically autoencoders, to check the non-linearity of the data. While PCA is working fine, I am going to explore non-linearity.

## **Deliverables**
In my research, I am delving into the exploration of dimensionality reduction techniques as a crucial aspect of developing surrogate models for spatiotemporal storm surge predictions. The objective is to enhance the efficiency of predicting storm surge events by investigating methods that can effectively reduce the complexity of the dataset. Through this exploration, I aim to identify and apply suitable dimensionality reduction techniques, such as autoencoders, to capture essential features of the spatiotemporal data. This process will contribute to a more streamlined and computationally efficient model, allowing for improved predictions and a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns in storm surge dynamics.
